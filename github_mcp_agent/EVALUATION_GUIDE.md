# GitHub Evaluation Agent Guide

## Overview

The GitHub Evaluation Agent is a sophisticated tool for evaluating GitHub profiles for technical roles. It provides comprehensive analysis including skill mapping, scoring, and hiring recommendations.

## Features

### 1. Role-Based Evaluation
- **Backend Developer**: Python, Java, Go, databases, APIs
- **Frontend Developer**: JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, CSS
- **DevOps Engineer**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, cloud platforms
- **Full Stack Developer**: Combined frontend and backend skills
- **Data Engineer/Scientist**: Python, R, SQL, ML frameworks

### 2. Comprehensive Scoring System
- **Technical Score** (0-100): Based on skills, experience, and code quality
- **Activity Score** (0-100): Recent contributions and consistency
- **Collaboration Score** (0-100): Team work and open source contributions

### 3. Evidence-Based Analysis
- Links to actual repositories demonstrating skills
- Code quality indicators
- Project complexity assessment
- Technology diversity

### 4. Hiring Recommendations
- **STRONG_HIRE**: Exceptional candidate
- **INTERVIEW_RECOMMENDED**: Good fit, worth interviewing
- **NO_HIRE**: Not suitable for the role

### 5. Red Flag Detection
- Inactive profiles
- Lack of relevant experience
- Limited collaboration
- Code quality issues

## Usage

### Basic Evaluation

```bash
# Interactive mode
python github_evaluation_agent.py

# Quick evaluation
python github_evaluation_agent.py torvalds "evaluate for backend role"
```

### Example Queries

1. **Role-specific evaluation**:
   - "Evaluate for a DevOps role"
   - "Assess frontend development skills"
   - "Is this person suitable for a senior backend position?"

2. **Skill analysis**:
   - "What are the strongest technical skills?"
   - "Show evidence of Python expertise"
   - "Analyze cloud and infrastructure experience"

3. **Collaboration assessment**:
   - "How well does this person work with others?"
   - "Show open source contributions"
   - "Evaluate team collaboration skills"

4. **Comprehensive report**:
   - "Generate a full evaluation report"
   - "Provide a hiring recommendation with justification"
   - "What are the key strengths and weaknesses?"

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Skills (40% weight)
- Programming language proficiency
- Framework and tool expertise
- Code quality and best practices
- Project complexity and innovation

### Activity Level (30% weight)
- Recent contributions (last 90 days)
- Consistency of contributions
- Number of active projects
- Maintenance of existing projects

### Collaboration (30% weight)
- Pull requests and code reviews
- Issue participation

- Documentation and communication

## Output Format

The agent provides structured evaluation reports including:

```
📊 EVALUATION SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

👤 Candidate: @username
📋 Role: Backend Developer
📅 Evaluation Date: 2024-01-23

📈 SCORES:
• Technical Score: 85/100
• Activity Score: 78/100
• Collaboration Score: 82/100
• Overall Score: 82/100

🎯 RECOMMENDATION: INTERVIEW_RECOMMENDED

💪 STRENGTHS:
• Strong Python expertise (10+ projects)
• Active open source contributor
• Experience with microservices

⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
• Limited experience with Go
• No recent Kubernetes projects

🔍 INTERVIEW FOCUS:
• System design capabilities

```

## Integration with HR Systems

The evaluation agent can be integrated into automated HR workflows:

1. **Bulk Evaluation**: Process multiple candidates
2. **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints available
3. **Export Formats**: JSON, CSV, PDF reports
4. **Customizable Criteria**: Adjust weights and requirements

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific role queries** for accurate evaluation
2. **Review evidence links** to verify claims
3. **Consider context** - junior vs senior expectations
4. **Combine with interviews** - this is a screening tool
5. **Update regularly** - GitHub profiles change

## Limitations

- Only evaluates public repositories
- Cannot assess soft skills directly
- May miss private/enterprise contributions
- Best for technical screening, not final decisions

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Evaluation Criteria

```python
# In your code
agent = await create_evaluation_agent(
    username="candidate",
    custom_weights={
        "technical": 0.5,    # 50% weight
        "activity": 0.2,     # 20% weight  
        "collaboration": 0.3  # 30% weight
    }
)
```

### Batch Processing

```bash
# Evaluate multiple candidates
for user in alice bob charlie; do
    python github_evaluation_agent.py $user "evaluate for devops" >> evaluations.txt
done
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"User not found"**: Check username spelling
- **"No repositories"**: User may have only private repos
- **Rate limits**: Use authentication token
- **Timeout errors**: Reduce evaluation depth
